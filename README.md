# irlaptimes

Work in progress

My goal for this project is to do similar to what I did [here](https://github.com/Razgrizaces/alkamel_stint_analyzer) with my alkamel stint analyzer. I will be creating another dashboard for iRacing and maybe include other interactive things like highlighting specific teams and etc. Also separation/highlighting with cars bc that's prob important too.

I'm currently using Selenium to generate data from an API that I created to interact with iRacing's data. The goal is to use Airflow with GCP/BigQuery to store the data in batches and hopefully store the data in real-time, or as it updates on iRacing. I'm not trying to overshadow or do more than the current iRacing reports discord, just a differnt take with similar data.
